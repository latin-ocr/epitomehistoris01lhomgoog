With s view to remedy the evils deplored‚ 1 have in-
troduced into my Seminary, Mn L’Homond’s f‘Epitonoe
Histomae Sacraef’ ns every way calculated to instruct
children in Latin, and at the same t'nne to'convey to
their understanding* useful and interesting truths. Al
va subsequent bookI have' introduced ‘⁴ De Vim's illua·
tribuo orbis Romae‚'’ which in point of Latinity, style,
mffauthenticityi'appears to my view superior to those
Roman writers to whom it is now used as a substitute,
“ Narrationes Eecerptaest a's fai· as my examinatlon has
emended, spp'esr's to merit much, and will have its
place i'n the 'colu-se “of instruction. ·

' 1 monis appi-ove of two elementary books entitled
“Epitome Himerae Sacrffi and “De Vim illustribus nr-
his Romae,’' for the following reasons: The neatness and

purity of the Latin, which by no means characterize ¹ ’

the Selectaeei Veteri, now commonly used; th'e brief and
simple structure of the sentences; the proper omission
of appendices, vocabularies, translations, &c'. which'
instead 'of facilitating· the prognem of boys, only
cherishsdispositionforidleneas. ⁴ - ’

The easy an'd apt succession of “De mm? &c to
“Epimmess’ iic. and lastly, the matter, which is calcu-
lated, in the highest degree, to excite the interest md
attention of boys.
